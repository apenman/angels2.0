# Angels 2.0

In the mid 70s, Bruce Conner produced a series of large-scale photograms with Edmund Shea, which they titled Angels. Using their bodies to block out light, the pair created life-sized ghostly figures in black and white. 

Angels 2.0 is an interactive recreation of this work written in Processing. Inspired by the use of the entire body in the original series, Angels 2.0 uses a Kinect to track the figure and "burn" it into the final image. The more still the subject stays during the time lapse, the resulting image becomes sharper. If the subject decides to move around, forms start to blur. By moving this project into the digital realm, the permanence of photopaper gets lost but the process remains similar. In 2.0, photograms can be recreated over and over until the perfect one has been captured.
